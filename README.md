CONTROLS: ARROW KEYS/WASD to move, SPACE to shoot, (G).

I've always liked Tyrian2000 as a kid so I tried to make something along those lines. What came out is an asteroids/tyrian litle hybrid.

Gameplay: You are trying to get away from the enemies. In every level you have to kill a specific number of enemies in order to escape. The game consists of 5 levels.

Your ship has to take 3 direct shots before it dies.
The enemy ships also have to take 3 direct shots to die.

Pressing G enters Godmode.
